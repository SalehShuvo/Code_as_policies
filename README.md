## Description
This repository contains the codebase for [Code as Policy](https://code-as-policies.github.io/) which has been updated for the current OpenAI API. The code from the interactive demo has been merged into a single script for convenience of running on the local machine.
## Instructions
The ```main_mod.py``` file is the updated script for Windows. Alternatively, the ```main_pygame_ubuntu.py``` file uses the pygame interface and is the working version to be run at Linux based systems.
* Clone the repository on your system and run the ```main_mod.py``` file. Update the API keys beforehand for using OpenAI API.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SalehShuvo/Code_as_policies
    python3 main_mod.py
    #or python3 main_ubuntu_pygame.py
    ```
* Enter your command according to the available objects and the environment setup. ```env_view.png``` shows the snapshot of the current environment state and ```Demo.mp4``` shows the video of the robot doing the action according to the given command.
